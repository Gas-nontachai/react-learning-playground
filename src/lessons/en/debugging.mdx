# 5.3 Debugging & beginner practices

Debugging is a skill you build with habits. Combine tooling, systematic thinking, and communication to unblock yourself quickly.

<br />

## Mindset
- Reproduce the bug reliably (record steps, inputs, browser info)
- Change one variable at a time to isolate the root cause
- Assume it’s your bug until proven otherwise—then widen the search

<br />

## Tools
- Browser DevTools: inspect network requests, component DOM, performance timeline
- React DevTools: check component tree, props, and hooks values
- `console.log` strategically to print state transitions (wrap in conditionals to avoid noise)
- TypeScript + ESLint: many “bugs” are type or lint errors waiting to be fixed

<br />

## Example workflow
1. Encounter a blank screen → open DevTools console
2. Read the error stack trace; click the file/line to jump directly to source
3. Add temporary logs around the suspicious component
4. Write a failing unit test if the bug is logic-related
5. Fix, rerun tests, and remove noisy logs before committing

<br />

## Communication
- Create actionable bug reports: title, steps, expected vs actual, screenshots
- Pair with a teammate when stuck for more than 30 minutes
- Share root-cause summaries after fixing critical bugs so others learn

<br />

## Workshop
- Break a component on purpose (typo prop name, wrong dependency) and recover using DevTools
- Practice stepping through code with the Sources tab debugger
- Keep a personal troubleshooting log so you can revisit techniques that worked well

> 💡 Use the playground on the right to experiment with the code and reset any time.
