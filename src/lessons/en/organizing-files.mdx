# 3.4 Organizing files

A clean folder structure keeps your team productive. Group related components, hooks, and utilities close to the routes that use them.

<br />

## Suggested structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── (marketing)/
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── (dashboard)/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   ├── lessons/
│   │   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   │   └── LessonList.tsx
│   │   └── students/
│   │       └── page.tsx
│   └── api/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/Button.tsx
│   └── lesson/LessonCard.tsx
├── hooks/
│   └── useLessons.ts
└── lib/
    └── fetcher.ts
```

<br />

## Principles
- **Feature-first**: keep all files related to one feature together, even if they mix UI and logic
- **Colocation**: components that are only used inside a route should live next to that route
- **Barrel files**: create `index.ts` to re-export related utilities and keep imports short

<br />

## Example: barrel file
```ts
// src/components/lesson/index.ts
export {LessonCard} from './LessonCard';
export {LessonHeader} from './LessonHeader';
```

<br />

## Workshop
- Audit your project and identify folders with too many responsibilities
- Move route-specific components into the relevant `app/` subfolder
- Create barrel files for common UI components to simplify imports

> 💡 Use the playground on the right to experiment with the code and reset any time.
