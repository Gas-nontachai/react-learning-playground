# 3.3 Not Found pages

A good 404 page helps users recover when they visit a route that doesn’t exist. In the App Router you can create `not-found.tsx` inside any route folder.

<br />

## How it works
- Throw `notFound()` inside `page.tsx` to render that folder’s `not-found.tsx`
- Add a global `not-found.tsx` in `app/` for fallback
- Provide links back to a safe location or a search bar

<br />

## Example

```tsx
// app/lessons/not-found.tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function LessonsNotFound() {
  return (
    <div className="rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-8 text-center">
      <p className="text-sm uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-400">404</p>
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Lesson not found</h1>
      <p className="mt-2 text-slate-600">
        The lesson you are looking for might have been renamed. Pick another one from the list.
      </p>
      <Link
        href="/lessons"
        className="mt-4 inline-flex rounded-full bg-slate-900 px-4 py-2 text-white"
      >
        Back to lessons
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<br />

## Tips
- Mention what went wrong and offer actionable steps (search, contact support, go home)
- Log 404 events if they happen frequently—maybe update your redirects
- Keep the tone friendly; a little personality goes a long way

<br />

## Workshop
- Build a custom 404 for one route branch and trigger it via `notFound()`
- Add analytics logging to track missing URLs
- Design a “recently visited” or “recommended content” section to keep users engaged

> 💡 Use the playground on the right to experiment with the code and reset any time.
