# 0.1 What is the Web

The web world consists of browsers, servers, and code files that communicate over the Internet.  
In this lesson we will build a foundation to understand "what happens when we open a web page."

<br />

## Key Concepts
1. Understand that this lesson is part of Section 0 – Fundamentals  
    and serves as a foundation before writing real React.  
2. Connect new vocabulary like Browser / Server / Request / Response  
    with things you already use, such as opening YouTube or a news site.  
3. Read the code examples and try explaining them in your own words to test your understanding.

<br />

## How the Web Works (visualized)

1. Open Chrome or Safari — this is the Browser  
2. Type a website address, e.g. google.com → the Browser sends a request (Request)  
3. The website's Server receives the request → processes it → sends data back (Response)  
4. The Browser takes the data and renders the UI so the user sees a web page

Simplified flow:
Browser → Request → Server  
Server → Response → Browser → Render UI

<br />

## Example code the Browser can read

<h1>Hello Web</h1>
<p>This is your first web page</p>

Try editing the text above in the Playground and see the result instantly.
