# 3.1 Routing basics

Learn Next.js file-based routing.

## Key ideas
1. Connect the topic to the big picture of **Section 3 – Routing**
2. Translate the new vocabulary into your own words to improve retention
3. Read the code sample aloud so you can reason about each line

## Workshop
- Modify the playground code and describe what changed
- Write down any open questions you still have
- Share your experiments with a study buddy or community

> 💡 Use the playground on the right to experiment with the code and reset any time.
