# 4.1 Mini project – setup

Before building a mini project, set up tooling, folder structure, and mock data so later lessons focus on features instead of plumbing.

<br />

## Goals
- Initialize a Next.js app (or reuse this playground)
- Install UI libraries (Tailwind, Radix, etc.) you plan to use
- Create sample JSON data for lessons, students, or orders

<br />

## Checklist
1. `npx create-next-app@latest mini-learn`
2. Enable TypeScript and ESLint
3. Add `src/` directory and move `app/` inside it for clarity
4. Set up base styles in `globals.css` and configure Tailwind tokens
5. Create `src/lib/data.ts` with placeholder arrays you can fetch later

<br />

## Example mock data
```ts
// src/lib/data.ts
export const students = [
  {id: 1, name: 'Mint', progress: 80},
  {id: 2, name: 'Beam', progress: 55}
];

export const lessons = [
  {slug: 'jsx', title: 'JSX', duration: '20 min'},
  {slug: 'state', title: 'State Basics', duration: '25 min'}
];
```

<br />

## Workshop
- Bootstrap a fresh repo or clean branch dedicated to the mini project
- Decide on the domain (learning tracker, recipe app, habit board) and write its one-sentence goal
- Document setup steps in `README.md` so teammates can clone and run it quickly

> 💡 Use the playground on the right to experiment with the code and reset any time.
