# 1.1 What is React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI).  
Its strength is helping us manage complex screens systematically and break code into smaller, easier-to-maintain pieces.

React was created by a team at Facebook to solve problems on web pages that update frequently and have state that changes based on user interactions.

## What problems does React solve

Before React, managing UIs with plain JavaScript often had problems such as:

- Scattered code — changing one place could break another
- Multiple direct updates to the DOM, causing confusion
- Repeated conditional rendering logic
- The larger the site, the harder it is to maintain

React proposes a new way of thinking:  
think of "UI = result of State"  
When the state changes, the UI updates automatically

## Main concepts of React

### 1. Component
React splits the UI into small parts called components, making them reusable and easier to maintain individually

### 2. State management
State is mutable data, such as the text in an input or the number of items in a cart  
React updates the UI to reflect state changes automatically

### 3. Virtual DOM
React uses a Virtual DOM to diff changes and update only the necessary parts, improving performance

## Example of a simple React component
```jsx
    function Hello() {
      return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
    }
```
