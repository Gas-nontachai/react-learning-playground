# 5.1 Deploy to Vercel – production checklist

Production deploys require a bit more rigor than a quick mini project. Treat each release as something your users rely on.

<br />

## Before deploying
- Confirm environment variables for all stages (preview, production)
- Review analytics/monitoring setup (Vercel Analytics, Log Drain, Sentry)
- Run accessibility and performance checks (Lighthouse, axe)

<br />

## Vercel best practices
- Use separate projects for staging vs production or leverage Vercel environments
- Protect main branch by requiring PR reviews and status checks before merging
- Enable automatic rollbacks so you can revert with one click

<br />

## Example workflow
1. Merge PR into `main` once tests pass
2. Vercel builds a new deployment and runs checks
3. QA verifies preview URL
4. Promote the deployment to production or configure auto-promotion from `main`

<br />

## After deploying
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in the Vercel dashboard
- Watch serverless function duration/usage to catch cost issues
- Keep a changelog so everyone knows what shipped

<br />

## Workshop
- Configure custom domains and verify DNS propagation
- Add health check endpoints for external monitoring services
- Practice the rollback flow so you are comfortable when incidents happen

> 💡 Use the playground on the right to experiment with the code and reset any time.
