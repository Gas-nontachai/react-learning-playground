0.2 Essential JavaScript

This section summarizes the key JavaScript syntax and ES6 features you need before learning React.
The goal is to help you read React code smoothly without getting stuck on JavaScript fundamentals.

Core Concepts
1. Understand that this lesson is part of Section 0 – Fundamentals and prepares the JavaScript skills you will use constantly in React.
2. Connect new terms like let, const, arrow function, array methods to real-life concepts such as keeping lists, items, or general data.
3. Read each code example and try explaining in your own words what the code is doing.

JavaScript Topics You Need for React

1. let and const
Used to declare variables.
- let — use when the value will change
- const — use when the value should remain constant

Example:
```js
let count = 0;
count = count + 1;
const name = "React";
```

2. Arrow Function
A shorter and cleaner way to write functions, heavily used in React.
```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

3. Objects and Arrays
The fundamental data types used everywhere in React.
```js
const user = { name: "Nontachai", age: 20 };
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
```

4. Essential Array Methods
map, filter, find, some, every
Example:
```js
const numbersList = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbersList.map(n => n * 2);
```

5. Destructuring
Allows you to extract values from arrays or objects.
```js
const userInfo = { name: "Nontachai", age: 20 };
const { name: userName, age: userAge } = userInfo;
```

6. Spread Syntax
Used to copy or merge arrays and objects.
```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const moreNums = [...nums, 4];
```
