# 4.6 Mini project – deploy

Ship the mini project so you can test real-world performance and collect feedback.

<br />

## Pre-deploy checklist
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` (if available)
- Fill in `.env.production` with API keys, then mark it in `.gitignore`
- Update `README.md` with deployment instructions

<br />

## Deploying to Vercel
1. Push your project to GitHub
2. Create a new Vercel project and import the repo
3. Configure environment variables under **Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Trigger a production deploy and test the result

<br />

## Post-deploy tasks
- Click through every page to confirm routing and data fetching works on the server
- Monitor logs via Vercel’s dashboard to catch runtime errors
- Share the URL with a friend and gather usability feedback

<br />

## Workshop
- Set up preview deployments for pull requests
- Add a status badge or deployment link inside the repo
- Practice rolling back to a previous deployment if you spot a bug

> 💡 Use the playground on the right to experiment with the code and reset any time.
